Programming exercises from COMP 251 Spring 2023

Exercise 00 - Write a program that computes the total number of iterations for (user-inputted) numbers to complete their Collatz sequences.

Exercise 01 - Write a program that repeatedly reads stings from standard input and then uses a function to reverse a string.

Excercise 02 - Write a program that accepts a 26-character string that represents a substitution cipher.

Exercise 03 - Write a program that repeatedly reads integers from standard input and displays them as digits in a 7 segment display.

Exercise 04 - Write a program that repeatedly reads integers from standard input (one per line) and adds them to a data structure. When EOF (end of file) is reached (fgets returns NULL), the program prints out the digits in reverse order. Your solution must read until EOF so that it can be used with a unix pipe.

Exercise 05 - Write a program that performs sentiment analysis for text input from standard input.
